# Hashes Question 4
#
# objective: Access the name from the hash below
#  (I assume this means access the value of the name, targeting "bob")
#
# person = {name: 'Bob', occupation: 'web developer', hobbies: 'painting'}

person[:name]

# It's kind of like targeting data in an array, but we call the hash, then
# indicate what key we want to use to get a value from.
# So, the keys are like a more flexible version of the array's ordered index

# It's kind of the same concept as below, just applied to hashes instead
# bob_array ['bob', 'web dev', 'painting']
# bob_array[1]

# For hashes:
# hash_name[:key]
