# RubyIntroExercises
(Exercises from Introduction to Ruby, for Launch School, organized by chapter)

I'm clumping together a lot of the CH1 exercises into just a couple of files
They'll be seperated by a line like the following:
--- question # ---
So that helps keep the data from being too spread out there.

I made unique files for the other chapters, though.

I have some pretty extended commentary and a lot of questions about 
advanced topics from these projects. I totally understand if it would be
detracting from the study course to answer them, but i think the questions
in my comments make for a good platform of discussion for continuing learning.

Maybe I'll bring up some ideas in the forms? Or are the forms not for asking
for technical help like Stack Overflow does? I mean, to get at some things, it's just
more efficient to talk and screenshare over Skype or Zoom, you know?
Anyway, that's more of something down the line, I just want to bring up the question of
"Where do I go for guidance when I cant figure things out on my own?"

That aside, let me know what you think about my coding style. 
I've put easter-eggs in more than a few of the exercises,
so it should be interesting to see the silly things I wrote in.

Also, I know that README files aren't supposed to be like letters, per-se, 
but I figure it's the electronic equivalent of leaving a note on my
project portfolio that I'm leaving on a professor's desk.

Just want to make an effort to be warm, you know?

I hope to improve my coding ability soon, and I look forward to studying hard

Sincerely,
