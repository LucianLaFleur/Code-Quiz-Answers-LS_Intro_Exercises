# Exercise question 8
#
# objective: make a hash using both Ruby syntax styles

# way 1 : hash rockets

h1 = {
:Rem => "Best girl"
:Emelia => "Elf-eared thot"
}

# way 2 : symbol-only colon-connector

h2 = {
  height: "161cm"
  weight: "54kg"
  blood_type: "A-"
}

#Notice the positioning of the " : ". Usually, :symbols start with
# the colon being leftmost. However, as a connector the symbol_key: can have
# its colon take the place of the hash-rocket.
