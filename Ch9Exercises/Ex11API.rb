Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources
and say which one you like best and why.

Instructions here are unclear. What exactly am I looking for or
trying to alayze here? Isn't there only one "source" for Ruby's core?
I mean, there are gem libraries and all that, but just what am I
supposed to be comparing?

Your video walkthrough explains nothing and expresses nothing about the
intent or objectives of this poorly-worded question.

Like, a "source" is where something comes from, do you mean "resource", as in
"reference material"?

The only thing I can piece together as a possible, constructive meaning
from this question is asking which "resource" I would go to in order as
to figure out how to pull off neat tricks with Ruby and understanding what
specific objects have what range of capabilities.

... Mu answer to what I think is the question being asked here ...

Now, I've heard chatter about elitists who look down on people who
research things on "Stack Overflow", but I find it more than adequate for
translating English-worded intentions into various examples of code for
finding actual solutions to realistic problems.
It's not a library of documetnation, but it's basically the biggest collection
of practical examples, which are like the pictures worth a thousand words
in this field.

When it comes to sorting through documentation, I've read a couple of other
sites that I'll mention here. Again, assuming we're talking about "resources"

Rubyist is just poorly organized, and poorly displayed, and doesn't give
meaningful examples to demonstrate things.

I am more partial to Ruby Monk's whole site, though I have a couple critiques
about layout being confusing at a glance, especially with the stupid fortune-
cookie sayings every time you run a bit of example code.
Still, they're a good reference for showing how things work, and it's
divided up by topics fairly well.

The documentation at ruby-doc.org is the most thorough that I have
found, though to say that it's "long winded" is too kind.
It's hard to sift through it all to find the particular functionality
you have a question about, but using the "find" function on my browser
and keywords helps me skim a bit better when it prattles on and on.
The qualitiy of example code in ruby-doc is also unclear at times
and not always demonstrative of the utility of whatever question is at hand.

http://overapi.com/ruby
Over API is, by far, the best in it's visual organization and laying out
items in an easy-to-find manner.
All it basically does for Ruby is link you back to ruby-doc. But the layout is
darn intuitive and helps me find things fast. For me, this is like
laying out all the tools in your toolbox to figure out how you can approach
a problem. I think it is a wonderful mid-level reference for going "I'm working
with this data type, so what methods and all can fiddle with to make something
cool happen?"

https://apidock.com/ruby/Array/uniq
When it comes to expident descriptions, apidock is my go-to. Consistently,
they have been able to break things down in a digestable manner.
The examples are generally concise and get the point across, but on the oddball
occasion I don't understand it, that's where Stack Overflow comes in handy.
User notes attached to entries also help to add clarity

I don't know of any list of "api sources", nor am I even sure what it meant
by that alien term.
I my response to this question is way the heck off the mark, then I can
always read more if given direction with greater clarity.
