This folder contains the exercises for chapter 1, intro to programming

I put a bunch of the questions together, adefying the instructions, and 
instead separating questions with:  --- question (number) ---
so they're all contained fairly concisely

You can still run the code and check it out just fine.
Thought this would be better than opening a bunch of little files.
I'll keep things separate for bigger code chunks though
